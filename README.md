The command used while creating React app

1) npx create-react-app companyapp
  Where npx is the Node package executed

2) npm run start(npm start)
   To run the react application which was created

For frontend, I have used the following technologies to create this application

1) HTML

3) JSX (HTML elements are combined with javascript code)
4) React JS
